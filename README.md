# KNN-VC Voice Conversion

This repository contains a Python script for performing voice conversion using the K-Nearest Neighbors Voice Conversion (KNN-VC) model. The script takes a source audio file and a reference category (e.g., "taher" or "ryan") to convert the voice in the source file to match the style of the selected reference category.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- PyTorch
- torchaudio
- pydub

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio pydub
# voice-conversion
